I love to learn new technologies and use this to advance others. I shares my learnings at conferences and through training. I wear my title as founder and CEO with pride since it also has an extra demention to me then the usal business speak. for me beeing a CEO also means being the Coding Executive Officer. This is driven by my  strong belief that great leaders in tech need to be technical! Only by staying on top of technology, you can lead the people that live and wok in tech!
